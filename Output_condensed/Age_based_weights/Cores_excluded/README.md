Moving up every 100 years, with a +/-1000 years, with decreasing weights linearly based on how close they are to the specified time

Cores ARE excluded (ODP984 seems to be throwing out the end-members in the northern ocean in this one...)
Might need to investigate getting more cores from other parts of the southern ocean
