1000 year slices
Weighting using the proxy count
The split for quadratic is determined using all proxies between lat_1 (-40deg) and lat_3 (50N)
Variance on the date range has been set to 0years
Jackknifing only on the hyperbolic tangent function
Only ran for 127-128kaBP +/-0.5kaBP
HYPERBOLIC TANGENT MODELLNG BOUNDARIES EXTENDED TO INCLUDE THE END-MEMBER REGIONS
THIS DOESN'T WORK WELL!
